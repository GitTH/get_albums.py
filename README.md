**get_albums.py**

*A utility to quickly pull down all a user's fb albums.*

This requires the python requests library.

    pip install requests

It also requires an access token which can be gotten from the [Graph API Explorer](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer) and placed in the same directory as this script in a file named "access_token".
